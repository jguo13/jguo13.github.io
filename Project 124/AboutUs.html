				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>SpokenMed was founded for the purpose of demystifying medical care in America. The goal is to create a space where barriers and misapprehensions about medicine can be removed. </p>
				<p>Specifically, SpokenMed recognizes that the current system of American medical care can be at odds with different cultures and religious beliefs. SpokenMed aims to minimize the tensions that occur between the two in order to increase medical care accessibility. SpokenMed provides a public forum where registered community members can submit questions, post information, or share direct links about a broad range of medical topics. SpokenMed also features professional contributors, including medical doctors and thought leaders from different cultures or religious beliefs.</p>

				<h1>Our Inspiration</h1>
				<p> Despite the growing number of ground-breaking research discoveries and increasing efficiency of medical technology, the American medical health-care system is still failing to reach a large portion of the population who needs medical care the most. A study done by the the National Institute of Health found that many minority groups in America skip potentially life saving health screenings out of a mistrust of Western medicine and the Western health care system. People feel that such a health care system lacks in an understanding of their cultures and traditions, and have often even reported rude or disrespectful behavior towards them from healthcare providers. Such experiences leads them to avoid getting care and instead turn to alternative methods of treatment such as Eastern medicines. These alternative methods could be greatly useful if used in tandem with medical treatments, however used alone they could lead to life-threatening outcomes. Project 124 creates a safe medium where people who have apprehensions about medicine can log on to ask questions and voice their frustrations as well as seek solutions. It is also intended for healthcare providers who themselves want to become more familiar with different cultures, traditions, and religious beliefs in order to enhance their medical practice.</p>
